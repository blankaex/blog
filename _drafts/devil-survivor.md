## good
* compelling and realistic story
* interesting & unique characters
* time management and interconnected story events
* simple but deep complexities in battle
* high freedom with builds and demons
* skill crack for self-adjusting difficulty

## bad
* 6 days of common route for 1 day of different ending
* limited skill availability
    * no ailment boost
    * only 1 copy of pierce
* overclocked
    * new skills & demonds kind of ruined balance
    * 8th days are just fanservice
