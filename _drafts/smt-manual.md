Games from the Super Famicom (SNES) era often came with printed manuals or user guides. The expectation was that you'd have these available as reference when playing because you obviously paid for the package and didn't just pirate the game, right?

So a lot of detail around gameplay and mechanics was intentionally left out of the actual games themselves, in part also due to technical limitations and game development paradigms of the time. However this doesn't hold up so well in 2025 now that the games and guides are largely lost to time.

Of course there are maniacs who write their own walkthroughs or spin up wikis full of detailed information, but if you want the true experience the devs wanted you to have then the official pamphlets are the way to go. As far as I know, nobody's translated this one to English so this is my gift to the [shinwunners](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genwunner).

Thank you for purchasing ATLUS' Shin Megami Tensei for the Super Famicom. Please read this user guide thoroughly before playing so that you can enjoy the game to its fullest. This guide will not be re-issued, so please take good care of it.

### Warnings
* Please ensure you disconnect the console from the wall outlet once you have finished playing.
* Please sit as far away from the TV screen as you can when playing.
* When playing for extended periods, be sure to take short 10~15 minute breaks every 1~2 hours to promote good health.
* The game cartridge is precision built, so please do not expose it to large fluctuations in temperature or strong physical impact when in use or storage. Also, please do not disassemble the cartridge.
* Do not touch the contacts of the cartridge, expose them to water, or do anything that may cause dirt buildup. This will likely cause malfunctions.

## 1. Story
Tokyo, the capital of Japan. In a corner of this metropolis called Kichijoji, a young boy lived together with his mother. He was a kind-hearted boy who cared for his mother, and they led peaceful lives.

One night, the boy has a strange dream.

> An otherworldly labyrinth. Speaking doors. A boy affixed to a crucifix. A boy tormented by demons. A mysterious woman. And a dubious ritual.

When he awoke from his dream, a murder had supposedly taken place in Inogashira Park and the town was in an uproar. The park had been barricaded by police, and nobody was allowed to set foot outside the town. In addition, an incomprehensible message had been sent to his PC right as he woke up. When he downloaded the file in question, it turned out to be a Demon Summoning Program, that allowed its user to call forth demons as allies...

### 1. Title Screen
You'll be greeted by the title screen when you press the start button. Use the directional pad or select button to highlight an option and press the A button or start button to begin the game.

* **Start**: Start the game from the beginning.
* **Continue:** If you save during gameplay, your party's status will be recorded as-is. There are two save slots, so use the directional pad to select the data you wish to load and press the A button to confirm. You can save the game at any communication terminal or at the PC in your room by selecting "save".

### 2. Enter your Name
Use the directional pad to select a letter, and press the A button to confirm. If you make a mistake, press the B button to delete one letter at a time. Once you have finished, select "END" and press the A button to finalize.

(You can press the X button or Y button to change pages and select different characters.)

### 3. Set your Stats
You can set the stats for each of the main characters. Please distribute the 18 points among the 6 available stats. Press up and down to select a stat, and use right (or the A button) to add 1 point. Use left (or the B button) to remove 1 point if you added too many.

The properties affected by each stat are explained on pages 14~17.

## 3. User Interface
### Dungeon Interface (3D Interface)
You'll see the 3D interface inside buildings and underground.

* **Moon Phase:** The current phase of the moon. This will change as you walk around, and has mysterious effects on the stength of demons and success rate of negotiation.
* **Current Location:** The current floor you are on and direction you are facing. Depending on the location, this element may not be displayed.
* **Money / MAG:** Can be viewed by pressing the A button. ¥ displays the amount of money you currently possess. This unit is displayed in Yen, however at a certain point the currency will change to Macca (ћ). MAG displays the amount of magnetite you currently possess. Magnetite is the energy demons need to materialize in the human world. It will gradually decrease as you walk around with demons in your party. If it reaches 0, the HP of your demons will gradually decrease. You can obtain MAG by defeating enemies or requesting it during negotiation.
* **Commands:** Can be viewed by pressing the A button. This is explained in more detail on pages 10~13.
* **Party:** Your current party members' names, current and maximum HP, MP, and status. This is explained in more detail on pages 14~17.

### Auto-Mapping System
The main character obtains this program via a transmission to his PC. This will display every tile you have walked on inside buildings and underground. The main character's party's current location will be displayed in yellow. Other features such as stairs and elevators will also be displayed.

### Overworld Interface (2D Interface)
* **Location:** Current location.

You'll see the 2D interface when traversing the overworld. Moon phase and current location will be displayed. Also when stationary, money and MAG will be shown on the top-right of the screen. You can press the A button to open the command menu to see additional information. Press the B button to return to the overworld interface.
