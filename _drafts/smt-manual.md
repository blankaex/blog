Games from the Super Famicom (SNES) era often came with printed manuals or user guides. The expectation was that you'd have these available as reference when playing because you obviously paid for the package and didn't just pirate the game, right?

So a lot of detail around gameplay and mechanics was intentionally left out of the actual games themselves, in part also due to technical limitations and game development paradigms of the time. However this doesn't hold up so well in 2025 now that the games and guides are largely lost to time.

Of course there are maniacs who write their own walkthroughs or spin up wikis full of detailed information, but if you want the true experience the devs wanted you to have then the official pamphlets are the way to go. As far as I know, nobody's translated this one to English so this is my gift to the [shinwunners](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genwunner).

## 1. Story
Tokyo, the capital of Japan. In a corner of this metropolis called Kichijoji, a young boy lived together with his mother. He was a kind-hearted boy who cared for his mother, and they led peaceful lives.

One night, the boy has a strange dream.

> An otherworldly labyrinth. Speaking doors. A boy affixed to a crucifix. A boy tormented by demons. A mysterious woman. And a dubious ritual.

When he awoke from his dream, a murder had supposedly taken place in Inogashira Park and the town was in an uproar. The park had been barricaded by police, and nobody was allowed to set foot outside the town. In addition, an incomprehensible message had been sent to his PC right as he woke up. When he downloaded the file in question, it turned out to be a Demon Summoning Program, that allowed its user to call forth demons as allies...
