I happen to know a gentleman and scholar who once shared with me an insightful analogy in regards to this topic. Paraphrasing his words, it went something like this.

> Imagine you're invited to a banquet by, let's say, the king. You're amongst other nobles sitting around a dining table and everyone else is walking over to the buffet and bringing back platefuls of mouth-watering food. Instead, you take out a lunch box full of shit. Brown, stinking, shit. As you're about to stick your fork into it, the man next to you asks "Why are you eating that when there's all of this delicious food just over there?"
> 
> You reply "I'm too lazy to go over there and get it."

Moral of the story: don't stream.
