Like most other gachaslop, *Jantama* makes you hop through seven different currencies to do literally anything, in the hope that by the time you get what you want, you'll have forgotten how much money you've actually spent. Fuck them, here's the breakdown of what you need to do to get the most out of your resources.

There are two main goals here. The first is to roll the gacha, which is how you obtain characters (*janshi*) and cosmetics. The second is to bond and ascend your characters which will unlock an alternate outfit, and additional emotes and voice lines (reading out *yaku*, complaining when you discard *dora*, etc).

## Rolling Gacha

    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

As a free-to-play player you will never see this so forget about it. Worth noting that if you use jade for a 10-pull on the gacha then you are guaranteed to receive at least one purple gift (which is pretty meagre in the grand scheme of things).

If you do want to buy jade then the fortune charm is the best value with the downside that you need to log in for 30 days consecutively to collect the full amount. Definitely not designed to pad MAU, remind you that the game exists, and annoy you into buying more jade.

    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Also pay-to-win only. Main use is for buying outfits because backgrounds are a big scam that can only be seen by you and cannot be used to flex on others. Note that outfits are only available during events to make you FOMO.

Can also be exchanged for jade which is probably a bad deal but as usual the vouchers are only sold in increments of "too few" or "too many" so you'll always have some change. Seeing a bit of a pattern here aren't we?

  </div>
</div>

The free-to-play way to roll gacha. Sometimes will be given out during events (usually require you to log in a lot or play a lot, for obvious reasons) and, if you're lucky, as an apology for server downtime and other drama. However the main way to obtain is by exchanging stardust (covered later).

Can use these whenever you want as there's no benefit to saving them; the 10-roll bonus only applies for rolls made with jade. Usually preferable to wait for events to get limited-time characters, but depends which characters and effects you want.

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Faith shop</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

You're given 1 faith per gacha roll, and you can use faith to buy characters and cosmetics in the faith shop for 150/50 faith respectively. Effectively a ceiling to prevent gacha trolling. Shop stock rotates periodically and not all characters are available in the faith shop.

Additionally, wishing stones are purchased from the faith shop at a 1:1 pricing. 10 wishing stones are required per ascension, so save 10 faith for each character you plan to ascend. Otherwise, spend however you like; save for event cosmetics, etc.

Obtained by rolling duplicates (characters or cosmetics) in the gacha, so not something that can feasibly be farmed intentionally. Used in the star shop to purchase cosmetics and gifts, which means used in the star shop to purchase cosmetics. Period. Shop stock rotates periodically so check back regularly.

Abundant currency that you don't really need to think too much about. A trivial amount is needed as an ante when playing in silver rooms or higher. Most people don't know about this because it doesn't matter (or they're bronze).

Check the copper shop daily and stock up on spheres. The shop can be refreshed for free once a day (and additional times with jade but don't ever do this either), allowing you to buy up to 4 spheres daily. Gifts can be purchased here too but it's not really worth it.

Relatively abundant item obtained mainly from events and the copper shop, but also fairly commonly from match chests in silver and above. There are eight varieties in total, and ten copies of two specific kinds are required for most bond ascensions. You should always keep at least 10 of each in stock, or at minimum a set of 10 each of the two that you require for your next ascension.

If you've been diligent about visiting the copper shop and collecting rewards then you'll probably have some excess. You can spend these in the illustration shop if you like, but illustrations are just player-sided loading screens that aren't visible to other players.

Gifts are teddy bears, cookies, that sort of thing. Mainly obtained for free as rewards from events and match chests, so not really worth buying with any currency. There's a few categories of gifts, and what you do with them depends on which:

* **Blue/Green Gifts:** Donate these to exchange for stardust. This is the how you earn stardust used to buy summon scrolls and ultimately roll the gacha.
* **Blue/Green Gifts (locked):** Some gifts will have a lock icon, indicating they cannot be donated. Give these to your characters for bond progression. If you give them the same kind of gift that they need for their ascension, you will get 50% more bond exp.
* **Purple Gifts:** Save for bond ascension. Need 5 of a specific kind, and you don't want to be caught short. As tempting as it may be, **do not gift or donate purple gifts**. Even if you have extras, you never know which character you'll pull next.

Usually gifts you receive as event rewards come in bags and chests. Excluding the purple chest, you can open these immediately and save/donate/gift as described above. The purple chest allows you to choose which gift you receive (as opposed to the random gift bags), so it's advisable to save these for when they're needed.

</div>

Intermediary currency used for purchasing summon scrolls (gacha rolls) and for bond ascension. Practically obtained by donating blue and green gifts you receive as event rewards or match rewards. It costs 100 stardust per ascension, so save enough for each character you plan to ascend.

Summon scrolls cost 50 stardust each, so you can put any extra you have towards that. There's a monthly cap of 5 summon scrolls purchases and this is technically farmable as you can play matches for gifts to donate, but this is not really feasible as you'd probably need to play around 300 hours a day to hit the limit.

  </div>
</div>

If you haven't been a good goy buying spheres from the copper shop daily and saving purple gifts then this is your whale fallback if you really must ascend your character right now. Realistically you won't ever be doing this though because the only source of wishing stones is faith, which is much better spent elsewhere, and spheres/gifts can be had for "free".

In practice this is just a proxy that requires 10 faith per bond ascension. You need 10 wishing stones per ascension and each wishing stone costs 1 faith. This means you should just hold onto your faith and purchase the wishing stones once you've met all of the other ascension requirements.

In addition to 20 spheres, 5 purple gifts, 100 stardust and 10 wishing stones, max bond points is the final requirement for bond ascension. Bond points are obtained by using the character in ranked, and giving gifts or bond items: green gifts give 200pt, and blue gifts/bond items give 1000pt. 88000 bond points are needed in total.

Bond items can be obtained from events (Lover's Knot, Valentine's Day Chocolate, Happy Coupon, etc). Additionally when you play a character with max bond, you'll instead progress a 1000pt bond bar which gives a Bonding Heart worth 1000pt when complete. It's advisable to play max bond characters as Bonding Hearts can be saved if you don't have any characters you currently want to bond. Bond items are especially useful to stock because they don't count towards the daily 12 gift limit.
