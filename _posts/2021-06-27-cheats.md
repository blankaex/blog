DRM in video games has been a topic of discussion for quite a while, as far as I can recall. It's a great topic that lends itself well to ignoramuses who can band together and spew jargon they don't understand at a shared enemy as a form of self-validation. There's a lot to say on the topic, but I feel like the masses have recently shifted their focus from DRM to anti-cheat. My hot, victim-blaming take for today is: the problem isn't the developers, nor is it the cheaters—it's the players.

When I think of invasive anti-cheat in video games, three somewhat recent examples that come to mind are *Genshin*, *Valorant*, and *Street Fighter V* (all of which happen to be terrible games, I might add). As far as I can tell, the common factor that had people up in arms about these games is the fact that their anti-cheat mechanisms were implemented in the kernel. This made it very easy for people to point and shout "rootkit!" despite having no understanding of the motivations.

While "rootkit" definitely has negative connotations due to its association with malicious software, rootkits aren't necessarily malignant by definition. I've written a rootkit in the past as a proof of concept that did nothing more than hide itself from userland and provide a privilege escalation vector. Sure, it could be exploited for malicious purposes, but just because you can beat someone over the head with a baseball bat doesn't mean baseball bats are inherently evil.

So, you might be wondering why the developers felt it was necessary to ship kernel modules with their video games. [Detecc Philippe from *Riot Games*](https://twitter.com/mirageopenguins) summarises the technical details quite succinctly in a [kind of cringey blog post](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-null-anti-cheat-kernel-driver/), but the tl;dr is that cheaters are using kernel modules too, and these would be impossible to detect without kernel privileges.  

I recall [*MiHoYo* being under fire](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/5818) for having their *Genshin* anti-cheat active even when the game was not running. "Why does the anti-cheat need to be on when I'm not playing the game?" is the knee-jerk response, but if you take the time to think about the implementation then the reasoning becomes quite clear. The game doesn't need to be running if you're loading kernel modules and overwriting syscalls, and discovering these modifications after the fact is extremely difficult.

*Street Fighter V* is a bit of a special example. Although most players were upset just at the thought of a rootkit because they didn't know any better, actual learned individuals were more appalled at how awful the implementation was. *Capcom*'s kernel module was built so poorly that it could be easily exploited by _any_ userland application to gain kernel privileges. This is an interesting point to highlight real issues with anti-cheat, but really it's just another example of Japanese developers demonstrating why the rest of the world thinks they're a joke.

There's also a glaring contradiction that leads me to believe that common arguments against anti-cheat are fundamentally flawed. People don't like game developers shipping rootkits because they don't want game developers invading their privacy and using them for telemetry. Chances are, even if they are collecting your data, they're just using it to improve the game and provide a better experience. But you have no way to verify this, and you don't want to take them at their word.

What about your operating system? Your entire Windows kernel is proprietary Microsoft code, which you have no way of validating. A kernel module that comes with one of your games is just a drop in the ocean. Microsoft tries to take advantage of you for advertising purposes and this is okay, but game developers trying to stop the very cheaters you're complaining about is not? I can appreciate reducing attack surface and defence in depth, but this just sounds like you've been in a car crash and you're demanding the doctor fix your broken fingernail before they fix your broken neck.

Now, I think this would be a good point to stop and make it clear that, despite everything I've said so far, I am definitely **not** in favour of anti-cheat. The point I was trying to get across was that building anti-cheat is actually a very difficult engineering problem. I'd go so far as to say that it's impossible to implement anti-cheat without violating the user's freedom in some way. There are even hardware components that snoop buses in ways software cannot detect to provide cheats. It's a losing battle no matter how you spin it, so I can appreciate the difficulty that developers need to face.

This brings me to my next point. Whenever I'm facing a hard programming problem, it's usually because I shouldn't be doing it that way. If the problem seems really hard or impossible, then you're probably operating under a bugged assumption. Piracy is a great example of this. You'll never be able to fix piracy, but *Spotify* and *Netflix* changed the game by thinking differently. This is also the solution to cheating in video games. The winning play is to not care.

Developers are only shipping anti-cheat solutions because players get upset when they play with cheaters. Nobody wants to play games that have a reputation for high amounts of cheating, so developers are financially motivated to build better anti-cheat. But better anti-cheat comes at the cost of the user's privacy and freedom, which again makes the players upset. You can't have your cake and eat it, so which is it? Do you care more about cheaters or privacy?

Personally I'd much rather play without anti-cheat and deal with cheaters than play with anti-cheat. Someone's ruining your *Dota* game? Just leave or play with friends next time. The problem wouldn't exist if people didn't get so heated about video games in the first place. People cheat all the time when playing chess online, but I don't think anyone really cares that much. They actually enjoy the game so it's just "ugh, whatever" and they move on with their day.

Just my opinion though. Maybe it's different for people who live on *CS:GO* and it's meaningful to their lives in some way. I dunno.
