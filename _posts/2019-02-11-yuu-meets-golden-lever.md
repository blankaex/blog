# A bit about Korean Levers

A company called Attasa set up a booth at Mastercup where players could purchase Korean levers. Many players had some interest in Korean levers, but never really got into them because they didn't know where to start. This gave them an opportunity to easily buy levers to try for themselves.

The levers on sale were provided by Crown. There were two different levers for sale, the Crazy Dongpal lever and the Help Me lever, named after the two famous players.

The standard lever on an arcade cabinet in Japan is the Sanwa JLF, which is what the majority of Japanese players are most familiar with. However, the levers used in Korea and other countries are all different.

That said, levers from Korea, our next-door neighbour and Tekken powerhouse, can be found here and there in Japanese arcades. Many Japanese players have had a reasonable chance to try them out.

There are a number of players who have some interest in Korean levers, but not enough to go out of their way and order one online just to try. Attasa's booth at Mastercup 10 last year lowered this barrier of entry, and not just their on-site stock, but even their online inventory was completely sold out.

I'm willing to bet it's thanks to social media that the information spread like wildfire, and made everyone want to give it a go.

# There's a guy in Indonesia making a crazy lever

I've been to Indonesia maybe 4 or 5 times to participate in events and tournaments. One time when I was there, trying to make some friends with the locals, I was suddenly approached and given a spring. I was told that it's a hand-made spring made to modify a Sanwa JLF.

I actually left it on my desk for about half a year, but my curiosity got the better of me one day so I decided to try it out. I immediately noticed a difference; my rate of missed inputs immediately decreased. I was so amazed that I messaged the creator to thank him. That's how I found out about the Golden Lever.
