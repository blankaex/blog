The man with no memories had been sleeping, dreamlessly.

<span class="serif">
He woke, and there was a brief moment where he saw and heard nothing. Then his senses came
rushing to him, and he felt a smooth coldness pressed against his face. He blinked, found
himself resting on a table. His arms were splayed. There was little feeling in them, so he flexed
his fingers, experimentally, and then looked up.

<span class="serif">
He was seated in a diner. It was a seedy, third-rate sort of establishment, with only a few,
cramped booths, and muck on every surface. Overhead were fluorescent lights—their sterile
whiteness made the man wince. He stared out the window, and his reflection stared back. It was
dark out.

<span class="serif">
The diner was empty apart from the man with no memories and a waitress, who was listlessly
sweeping the floor. The man watched her for a moment: young, uniformed, all flab and acne
scars. She noticed and stared back, and the man turned away. And then he saw the meal before
him: a plate of chips and a half-eaten bacon sandwich. He tried a chip. Cold. Had he ordered
this? He didn’t remember. He didn’t remember much of anything.

<span class="serif">
The man with no memories blinked. He could recall nothing. How he had ended up here; why
he had fallen asleep—nothing. Why he had ordered what he had. Where he had come from.
Who he was. Nothing.

<span class="serif">
“Oh,” he said. “Oh, God.” He paused, momentarily panicking. Then, to the waitress,<br>
“Miss?”<br>
The waitress turned to him curiously and replied, “Sir?”<br>
“What’s the time, sorry?”<br>
She read from a mobile phone: “One-eighteen.”<br>
“Do you, um, have any idea when I got here?”<br>
“My shift starts at nine-thirty,” she said. “You was here before that. Sound asleep all this time.”<br>
“Is anyone else in? Someone who was here before?”<br>
“They’ve all gone home. The manager is in his office, if you want him. Doubt he could help you,<br>
though. He just stays in there. Does the papers, I think.”<br>
“Thanks.”

<span class="serif">
The waitress returned to her work. The man with no memories turned to the window, staring
thoughtfully at his reflection. It was a plain man who looked back. His hair was vaguely dark,
its colour and details distorted by the imperfect mirror of the window. He was not ugly, but not
quite handsome: a mixture somewhere in-between was more like it, though he could not decide
which way he leant. His eyes he liked. He would have been captivated by their almond shape
had they been on anybody else. They weren’t though; they were his, and so, for the sake of
modesty, he let his gaze move on. He wore a white dress shirt, wrinkled from sleep and overuse.
His top button was done up, and as soon as he noticed, the man with no memories undid it,
almost tearing it off in the process.

<span class="serif">
It now occurred to the man that he had no idea what he was carrying, that he had not yet
searched himself. If there was something—anything—that could clue him in on who he was, or
what had happened to him, he had to have it. So he rifled through his pockets, and gathered
what he had on the food-crusted top of the table. Handkerchief. Earphones. Wallet: there were
several fifties and twenties, and some change as well – around two hundred dollars in total. No
cards, though: no ID. Chewing gum wrapper. Phone: its clock was in time with what the
waitress had said. Phone... _Phone!_

<span class="serif">
Heart thumping, he checked his contact list. There were only two entries: one for a Rodney
Schofield, and one for a Wilton Fuller. He dialled them in that order. Schofield did not pick up,
but when the man dialled for Fuller, he was told that he had tried to call himself. Was he
holding somebody else’s phone? Had the entry in the contact list been misnamed? The man
wondered, and then cast aside those off-chances and doubts. He was in need of a name, and here
was one, waiting. He decided: Wilton Fuller was he.

<span class="serif">
Wilton Fuller, he repeated, mentally. _The fuck sort of name is that?_ But he glanced sideways at
his reflection in the window, and now he wore an almost goofy look. He supposed that had
something to do with his new name, and the sense of fulfilment that came with it.

<span class="serif">
There was still the problem of where he had come from. Of what to do next. Wilton did not
even know who he was—truly know; he was vaguely himself, but there was, had to be, more to
him. For now, he decided to leave the diner. He went to the men’s room and took a piss, a nice,
long, mesmerising stream of it. Washed his hands. Left the restroom. Then, because he had no
idea what would come after, Wilton ordered a bottle of Vanilla Coke—the waitress had to leave
her broom, and dart behind the counter— and left.

<span class="serif">
Outside, Wilton couldn’t see much of anything; the starlight was meagre, and the streetlights
were sparse. What he could make out through the darkness had him thinking of poverty. Crime.
Slums. The first thing he noticed was the decay: everything was crumbling, everywhere
rundown. Under the streetlights he could see potholes, and gaping cracks in the footpath. There
was graffiti, on the road, on walls.

<span class="serif">
It all made him uneasy.

<span class="serif">
He took a swig of Coke to calm his nerves. Then he began walking along the footpath,
purposelessly, cutting across empty roads, winding through suburbia made invisible by the
darkness.

<span class="serif">
He came across the girl at daybreak. He had been walking for nearly five hours by the time on
his phone; he had long since zoned out. At first he saw the girl out of his peripherals, and
thought she was a plant, or a trick of the light; then, as he drew closer, he realised she was
human—and watching him.

<span class="serif">
She was slumped against a low brick wall, cigarette in mouth. She would have been pretty—
was pretty—but for the scowl she wore; it chilled Wilton, made him dread things. It certainly
did not belong on somebody her age. Wilton did not know by how much, but the girl was
younger than him: she looked rough, yet there was still tenderness beneath the steel. Her hair
framed her face, black and long, stringy. She wore an undone cardigan over a dress shirt with tie
and a pleated grey skirt, and at her waist was a holstered pistol. Wilton eyed it warily.

<span class="serif">
The girl eyed him back with eyes like ice.

<span class="serif">
They stayed like that for a moment. Wilton tried to keep himself pokerfaced, but the girl had a
cold air about herself. He was unnerved.
The girl said, “Who are you?” She did not move—she seemed more blasé than ever, if
anything—but Wilton heard the threat in the words. Still he said nothing.

<span class="serif">
The girl continued to stare at him. Then she sighed, and rose, and as her shadow moved with her,
Wilton noticed it for the first time: outspread from her shadow was a single wing. It was an
angel’s wing, a dove’s, a bird-of-prey’s; it was the silhouette of all wings epitomised. And it
stretched out across the wall, impossibly long, and expanded until it met and melted into other
shadows.

<span class="serif">
Wilton forgot his fear, and exclaimed, “The… Fuck…! Is... That..?” He twisted his arm around.<br>
He patted himself on the back. “That.”<br>
The girl imitated him. Then she gave him a look, questioningly.<br>
“On the wall. Your shadow, I mean.”<br>
“Oh,” she said, and the ice in her expression melted away. Now she looked her age.<br>
“You can see it.”<br>
“Yes.”
