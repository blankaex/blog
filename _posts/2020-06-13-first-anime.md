excerpt: "My answer to this question depends on how you want to define \"first\"."

This question came up when I was chatting with some mates. I went to answer, but then I caught myself, realising that I didn't really have a good answer. Or maybe I had multiple good answers; that's subjective, I guess. Regardless, I promised to blog about my thoughts on the matter, so here we are.

Superficially, it seems like a pretty straightforward question. You may have to go check MAL or something to confirm, but otherwise it's just a simple, closed question. Find the series and name it. The ambiguity comes in when you get into the nitty-gritty about what "first" means in this context. I had a couple of ideas on how this could be interpreted. This is what I ended up with.

# 1. First Ever

This definition of "first" encompasses _literally everything_. Anything you may have seen at all, even in passing, be it at a friend or relative's house, or even on display at an electronics store. For most, I imagine this would be whatever you saw on your local Saturday morning kid's TV channel. Needless to say, I'm no exception.

I actually don't remember what this might be, and I don't really have a good way of finding out. Chances are I was too young for anything to leave a lasting impression on me. I remember _Sailor Moon_, _Yu-Gi-Oh_ and a handful of others, but I can't recall where they fit in chronologically. Based on the circumstances I remember them in though, I would probably say _Dragon Ball Z_ or _Pokemon Johto_ if I had to pick something.

# 2. First Intentional

When asked about the topic at hand, I don't expect many people to answer as above. The first anime you just happened to see likely holds no sentimental value to you, even more so if you only saw a couple of odd episodes on TV by chance. Thus, I came up with this second definition: the first anime you sat down and watched solely for the sake of watching it, with the intention of actually seeing it through.

Honestly, this still goes back a bit too far for me to remember. There was one show I had on VHS that I remember sitting down to watch one evening. I don't remember much of it other than a bit of romance, some mechas and Evangelion-looking sailor uniforms, but a bit of googling a few years ago turned up _Project A-Ko_. Not sure if that's the one, but it has a couple of similarities to lead me into believing so. Maybe I'll give it an honest rewatch one of these days.

# 3. First Remembered

You're probably getting pretty tired of all of these vague non-answers, but rest assured, I actually remember what my first anime was by this definition. Here we'll cover the first anime I can clearly remember putting on and watching. If you're excluding things you saw in passing, this is probably a definition you'd go by.

My dad had _[a-o]_'s release of _Prince of Tennis_ on a hard drive from a friend, which I did watch most of (the series wasn't finished by then). He also got me a counterfeit Chinese DVD box set of _Naruto_, which I also watched but also wasn't completed at the time. The problem is which came first, which again I don't really remember. Kind of ironic considering I said I had a good answer this time, but I want to say I saw _Prince of Tennis_ first. Was definitely a great trip down memory lane revisiting this with convex.

# 4. First Sought

Up until now, everything I've seen has just been passive. By this, I mean I didn't go out of my way to find something in particular to watch, I only watched what happened to be available and within arm's reach at the time. Thus for this section, I wanted to cover the first anime I actively sought out for the purpose of watching it.

This one I definitely do remember; the intentionality probably helps. It was _Inazuma Eleven_. I think I saw a few episodes of the dub on Nickelodeon and I wanted to see more, so I found some streaming site and went through the episodes on that. I didn't finish it because again, the series hadn't finished airing at the time. Shoutouts to my boy Eternal_Blizzard for slogging through this again with me as well.

# 5. First Hobby

Following on from _Inazuma Eleven_, I realised how easy it was to find anime on the internet, so I watched _One Piece_ for a while too, remembering it from those morning TV shows. However, at this stage I wouldn't say I "watched anime", I just "watched _One Piece_". So here, I wanted to give an honourable mention to the first series I watched when I actually started watching anime as a hobby.

Not sure how many this comes as a surprise to, but the award for this section goes to _Angel Beats_. It was shortly after it had aired, and I remember hearing about it on a forum I frequented at the time. I wanted to see some more because it did leave a bit to be desired, but there wasn't really anything else since it was one cour. A friend recommended _Clannad_ as a substitute, and I don't know of any similarities other than Maeda Jun, but I started there and then saw _Haruhi_, _Lucky Star_, and all the other "classics" that made rounds back then.

# 6. First Seasonal

Until this point, I was only watching shows that had already finished airing. I think I might've been trying to get through all the aforementioned "classics" that everyone seems to always refer back to, before I started picking up seasonal shows. I also watched a few interesting-looking older shows, but that's besides the point. Here's where I talk about the first seasonal anime I watched. I don't think you'd consider this definition of "first" to answer the question unless it was specified, but I may as well since I'm here.

Funnily enough, this is where my memory gets a bit fuzzy again. I don't even really remember which season I started picking things up in. Fortunately I use a watch tracker, so I was able to narrow it down to some degree. I don't recall watching any of Winter 2011 while they were airing, but I do remember some of Spring 2011. As far as which came first, I don't actually know. It probably depends on the air dates and fansubs, so it's a toss up between _Steins;gate_, _Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai 2_, _Kaiji 2_, _A-Channel_ and _Nichijou_. I hate that I don't remember which it was.

# 7. First Fansub

There are probably only a select few people have the same answer for "what was the first anime you watched?" and "what was the first anime you fansubbed?" I'm not one of them, but I figured I might as well throw this one in for the sake of it. Interestingly, a lot of people seem to think I'm a fansubber despite the fact that I've never gone around calling myself one. I guess it just comes with the territory if you hang around the scene for as long as I have.

That said, I have had a hand in putting English words on Chinese cartoons on the odd occasion, and the first instance of this was _Hai to Gensou no Grimgar_ with _Hiryuu_. Ironically, this came about because I kept bugging Hyaku to release it and vale stalling it to eternity. Eventually, Hyaku just asked if I wanted to do it myself and I was like yeah ok. _Kakegurui_ is also worth mentioning here. It was the first show I subbed from the beginning, also thanks to my boy Hyaku. Naine killed that dream though üòê rip Hyaku, rip tab lesbos.

That was a pretty long-winded and convoluted answer for what was supposed to be a very short and clear question. As they say though, the devil is in the detail, and this is surely more interesting than naming a series and getting on with life. Anime is serious business, you know?
