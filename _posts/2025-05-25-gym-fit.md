I was shopping for some new gym clothes a while back and when I saw [JJANGE's Toji-inspired fit](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cmwSFrgMjBM) I knew what I needed to do. Took a bit of time to source all the pieces I wanted but I'm pretty happy with where I ended up so here's some fit pics.

## Top

Top is a Tactical HeatGear Compression tee from Under Armour. I had to ask a friend to bring me a few of these from the US because all of the models available locally had an ugly logo on the chest or neckline, whereas this one is nice and hidden.

It's comfortable and breathable, and can be thrown in the washer & dryer no problem. Pretty important for gym wear. I also use it as an under layer when snowboarding on the warmer spring days.

## Bottom

Down the bottom I've got sweatpants from Fear of God Essentials in the dark oatmeal colour. Even if it weren't for the inspo, there's something about wearing grey sweats to the gym that just feels right.

They're nice and comfy so great for gym use, but you do wanna tie up the drawstrings when doing deadlifts or rows or anything of that nature. I also wear them a lot casually too cause they're so easy to slip on.

## Shoes

On feet I'm rocking the Nike SB Zoom Janoski model. It was only an extra $20 or so to customize the colours via Nike By You to get the stealth Louboutin look and the "Megami Tensei" tagline on the label.

I wore Vans previously but I wanted something a bit less shit but still suited to lifting (i.e. relatively low and flat) and realised that skateboard shoes fit the bill pretty well.

I also threw in the Ortholite insoles from my snowboard boots, which are a lot comfier than the stock Nike ones. I have aftermarkets in my snowboard boots so I had these lying around; pretty happy to put them to good use.
