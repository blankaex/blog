We're a few days into the [Uniqlo U 2023 Autumn/Winter collection](https://www.uniqlo.com/jp/ja/contents/collaboration/uniqlo-u/23fw/men/) and pieces are already flying off the shelves. It's popular every year but I feel like things are going out of stock a lot faster than usual. Some items were already sold out on day one, so here's my top 5 while they are still available.

## [5. Broad Oversized Shirt (¥3990)](https://www.uniqlo.com/jp/ja/products/E461765-000/00)

What can I say, it's just a really nice shirt. It's made to be oversized so it has that big, boxy silhouette by design—so it doesn't suffer from the problems of simply sizing up (i.e. looking like you stole your dad's shirt).

The material feels premium; it drapes and creases nicely. It's just the right size to be worn standalone or open over an undershirt. The olive colour is also very muted, almost grey, so it's very easy to style as well.

There's also a lot of noticeable attention to detail in the construction. The stitching around the shoulder area is done well and thoughtfully, and the back of the shirt drapes slightly longer than the front for a sleek look if worn untucked.

Olive is definitely the winner here, but brown isn't bad either. I would probably stay away from the cream; it's pretty easy to mistake for a dishevelled dress shirt.

## [4. Brushed Jersey Pants (¥4990)](https://www.uniqlo.com/jp/ja/products/E461548-000/00)

These are pretty interesting. They land somewhere in between sweatpants and trousers, with a pretty strong bias towards sweatpants.

I'd say they work well for more casual/street outfits where you want the comfort or function of a sweatpant but the appearance of a slightly dressier trouser.

It's got a slight taper around the calf, which is a nice break from all the wide pants we're seeing lately. Notice that the hem isn't elasticated either, so they break nicely on your shoes too.

Dark grey is definitely the play here. There's also a brown and blue but those don't have the same hint of class that the darker pair have, which is the main draw of this piece.

## [3. Wide-fit Parachute Cargo Pants (¥3990)](https://www.uniqlo.com/jp/ja/products/E460268-000/00)

I know I just finished talking about how tired I was with wide pants, but these are only wide in name. When you actually try them on you'll notice they have more of a straight cut than a wide fit, although it definitely isn't slim by any stretch of the definition.

The fabric stood out to me the most on this piece. It's a bit sturdier than it looks and has a feel similar to a tough nylon, but it looks more like a natural fiber, so it avoids looking too athleisure/techwear.

It's also got laces around the cuffs, which is a welcome addition. It's a bit of extra effort compared to the plastic pull tabs, but a lot more comfortable (and better-looking). Unfortunately it doesn't affect the taper too much, but it is a noticeable switch-up.

Olive and black are standard cargo colours, and you can't go wrong with them on this piece either. There's a beige as well which makes them look more like a work pant. Not necessarily a bad thing, but definitely a different vibe.

## [2. Drawstring Shoulder Bag (¥2990)](https://www.uniqlo.com/jp/ja/products/E461185-000/00)

The next item I'm bringing up is more of an accessory than a piece of clothing. It's not the first time they've brought this around, but it keeps coming back for a reason.

It's functional and stylish so no complaints from me. Can be worn cross-body or over the shoulder, and both styles show off the folds and flowiness well.

I'm pretty into the wine colourway. It looks like it'd be a nice accent on the all-black uniforms you'll usually find me donning in the colder months. There's also a standard black and natural (white), and a greyish green which also look great.

[There's a small version as well](https://www.uniqlo.com/jp/ja/products/E462681-000/00), which is just the same thing shrunk down. Might be more up your alley if you don't bring too much around, but relative to coats and other winter outerwear, I think the regular size works out better proportion-wise even if you don't need all the carrying capacity.

## [1. Padded Volume Jacket(¥4990)](https://www.uniqlo.com/jp/ja/products/E462851-000/00)

This jacket is easily the best item from this season's drop. Unhooded puffer jackets have been in for the past few seasons and show no signs of leaving any time soon. As with the bag, functional and stylish.

The semi-crop stands out, giving the jacket an ideal boxy shape without wasted length. The way the collar opens up on its own to show off necklines and accessories is also very welcome; lower quality jackets tend to just obey the zipper.

I'm also a fan of the material. It's got a bit of a brushed finish so it doesn't have the plasticy sheen that you find on cheap nylon jackets. The sizeable ribbing is also a much more fashion-forward look than the two-dozen rows of down you'd find on the likes of Patagonia or even Uniqlo's own ultra-light down series.

The jacket comes in a safe black colour, but all the other colours (natural, brown, olive) also look great. If you already have black or want to stand out from the crowd, brown is definitely a vibe with this one.
